 *  The function fibonacciBuzzFizz calculates the nth Fibonacci term in a
 *  typically iterative fashion. As it iterates, each term is checked for
 *  primality and then for divisibility by 3 or 5. If the term is prime,
 *  "BuzzFizz" will be printed. If the term is divisible by 3, "Buzz" will be
 *  printed. If the term is divisible by 5, "Fizz" will be printed. It should
 *  be noted that "BuzzFizz" will only print once. If a number is prime it will
 *  effectively ignore the divisibility. If none of these checks return true,
 *  the Fibonacci term itself will be printed.
 *
 *  Iteration was chosen over recursion since it is faster for higher numbers.
 *  Still, this function will only work for Fibonacci terms less than f(94).
 *  Larger numbers will cause overflow in the unsigned long long variable which
 *  stores them. In these cases, a message stating such will be printed.
